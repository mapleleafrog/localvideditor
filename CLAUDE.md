# soranji-vfx — Project Context

## What this is
A Remotion (React → MP4) VFX pipeline for a wedding walk-in video set to "Soranji" (~120 BPM). HTML/CSS-authored animation, rendered frame-accurate to MP4. Output: 1920×1080, 30fps. Scaffolded directly into this folder (the project root holds `package.json`; the source specs live in `specs/`).

## Creative direction (locked)
2D animation that reads as having depth via **shadows, bevel, and z-mapping/parallax** — NOT real 3D. **Pixel-art** is a featured aesthetic (MapleStory-style sprites, stepped/quantized motion, CRT/scanline looks). True-3D effects (Three.js: card stack, turntable, 2.5D depth-map) are intentionally left as typed `todo` stubs.

## Stack (pinned, identical versions — no `^`)
- remotion + @remotion/cli + @remotion/transitions + @remotion/media-utils + @remotion/paths + @remotion/shapes + @remotion/gif — all **4.0.472**
- React 19, TypeScript. No UI/state libraries (Tailwind was stripped from the scaffold).
- `@remotion/media-utils` is wired for audio **duration** (`getAudioDurationInSeconds`, sizes the timeline to the song). Beat is still a frame-derived metronome (configurable BPM/offset) — true FFT audio-reactive (`useAudioData`/`visualizeAudio`) is still `todo`.

## Architecture
- `src/effects/` is a data-driven registry grouped by category.
  - `catalog.ts` — the full ~110-effect catalog as metadata (the single source of truth). Every row starts `status:'todo'`.
  - `motions.ts` — single-layer animations; imports the catalog, overrides the implemented ids to `status:'ready'` with a `style(ctx) => CSSProperties`. Merges in the depth + pixel families.
  - `transitions.ts` — footage A→B; built-in presentations + custom CSS presentations + shipped shader presentations, the rest `todo`.
  - `depth.ts` — the 2.5D toolkit: `depthShadow(z)`, `depthScale(z)`, `bevel()` + depth motions.
  - `pixel.ts` — pixel-art motions (quantized/stepped).
  - `presentations.tsx` — custom CSS `TransitionPresentation` components (dip, flash, masks, zoom look-alikes, pixel reveals).
  - `index.ts` — `getMotion(id)` / `getTransitionPresentation(id, params)` (always safe-fallback, never throw) + `buildCreditsMarkdown()` + `readyMotions()` / `readyTransitions()`.
- Effects carry `tier` (Core/Ext/Adv), `engine` (css/canvas/webgl/three/either), `status` (ready/todo), `tags`, and `license`/`credit`.
- `Layer.tsx` is the single frame→ctx boundary: reads `useCurrentFrame()`/`useVideoConfig()`, computes `progress`/`t`/`beat`/`z`, mount-gates the layer, composes centering, and applies the motion's CSS.
- `Mushroom.tsx` renders animated GIF sprites via `@remotion/gif`'s `<Gif>` with crisp `pixelated` scaling.

## Conventions (non-negotiable)
- Frame-driven only. No @keyframes, setInterval, rAF, GSAP ticker, or R3F useFrame.
- Time-window layers by mount-gating in `Layer` (return null outside range). Do NOT wrap beat-reactive layers in a frame-rebasing `<Sequence>` — it desyncs the beat.
- `t` is ABSOLUTE composition seconds so loops + beat stay on the song grid.
- All assets via `staticFile()`. No remote URLs in components.
- BPM via `helpers.ts#beatKick(t, bpm, exp, offsetSec)` only — beat is frame-derived (no FFT). `project.bpm` + `project.beatOffsetInFrames` set the metronome; `Layer`/`Timeline` thread them into every `beatKick` call so beat-reactive motions lock to the song's tempo/downbeat.
- New effects = catalog entry + (if ready) an implementation override. Scenes reference effects by id.
- Composition length must equal footage content (transitions overlap; total = ΣsequenceDurations − Σtransitions).

## Coverage this build
- ~100 motions implemented (Ken Burns/zoom, pan, path, physics, CSS pseudo-3D, CSS camera analogs, loop/idle, beat-reactive, **depth/2.5D** `depth.ts`, **pixel-art** `pixel.ts`, **Retro / FX** + **Backgrounds** `retro.ts`, **Wedding** `wedding.ts` — romantic glow/grade (goldenHour, dreamGlow, romanticGlow, softFocusBreath, sparkleGlow) + full-frame atmospherics (weddingPetals, confettiRain, bokehLights, lightLeakWarm, sparkleField) meant for `fx` overlay layers). `todo` stubs: cardStack, photoFloat3D, revolve3D, bassWarp (need Three.js / real audio).
- ~41 transitions implemented: 7 built-ins (fade/slide/wipe/flip/clockWipe/iris), ~22 custom CSS presentations, 5 retro CSS transitions (crtOn, glitchCut, pixelDither, scanlineWipe, vhsRewind), and 7 shipped HTML-in-canvas shader presentations (filmBurn, bookFlip, crossWarp, crossZoom, linearBlur, ripple, filmDissolve). Remaining GLSL-only warps/glitch/particle/3D effects are typed `todo` and safe-fallback to `fade`.

## Shader transitions caveat
The 7 shader presentations are `engine:"webgl"` (HTML-in-canvas). They **render correctly** via `npx remotion render` / Lambda, but their **Studio preview** needs Chrome 149+ with `chrome://flags/#canvas-draw-element` enabled. They are excluded from the preview-safe `TransitionGallery`. Everything else previews with no flags.

## Compositions
- `Timeline` — the **generic, config-driven video composition** (the real video builder — see "Make a video").
- `SoranjiSample` — the fixed 180-frame BPM demo (footage A→B + windowed sprites + beat flash).
- `MotionGallery` — every ready motion on a sprite, labeled (QA surface).
- `TransitionGallery` — a reel cycling clips through every preview-safe ready transition.

## Make a video (Timeline)
The `Timeline` composition renders ANY video from a `project` config (Zod-schema'd props): a **clip track** (image/video clips joined by transitions) + positioned **overlays** (text/image with stacked effects) + a **background**. Effect ids resolve against `src/effects`, so new effects work immediately — one registry, exact preview, render-grade. Files: `src/timeline/schema.ts` (`projectSchema`, `SAMPLE_PROJECT`), `src/timeline/Timeline.tsx`; sample configs in `projects/`.
- **Edit:** `npm run dev` → Studio opens `Timeline` with a live props form + scrubber (or hand-edit a `projects/*.json`). Drop photos/clips in `public/media/`, reference as `media/<file>`.
- **Render:** `npm run render:timeline` (sample) or `npx remotion render Timeline out/video.mp4 --props=./projects/your.json`.
- Duration is computed from the config (`calculateTimelineMetadata`, async: max(Σclips − Σtransitions, overlay end, **audio end** via `audioEndFrames`), so the video lasts as long as the song). Overlays take `motions: string[]`, composed via `composeStyles` (`src/effects/compose.ts`).
- **Two ways to edit the same `project` schema:** the Studio props form (`npm run dev`) **or** the drag-and-drop editor below (`npm run editor`). Both render via the same `Timeline` composition + CLI pipeline.

### Audio & beat-sync
- `projectSchema.audio` is an array of soundtrack tracks (`src`, `volume`, `from`, `trimBefore`, `trimAfter`, `loop`); `Timeline.tsx`'s `SoundtrackLayer` renders each as `<Audio>` inside a `<Sequence from={track.from}>` (preview + render). Non-looping tracks **extend** the timeline via `audioEndFrames`; looping tracks fill it and never define it.
- **Beat-sync (not FFT):** `project.bpm` + `project.beatOffsetInFrames` drive the synthetic beat clock. Apply a beat-reactive motion (`beatPulse`/`beatShake`/`beatFlash`/`beatColorCycle`/`beatZoomCut`) to any clip/overlay and it pulses on that tempo — set BPM to the song and nudge the offset so the kick lands on the downbeat. Drop `.mp3/.wav/.m4a` in `public/media/`. Real waveform-reactive beat (bass/loudness) is still `todo` (`bassWarp`, `audioBars`, `waveform`).
- **Editor:** the Library **Audio tab** (`editor/src/components/AudioPanel.tsx`) sets BPM/offset and adds/edits soundtrack tracks; `/api/media` now returns `{ assets, audio }` (audio split out of the visual list); `Preview` reads audio lengths in-browser to size the `<Player>`.

## Soranji Studio — the drag-and-drop editor (`editor/`, `npm run editor`)
A real timeline NLE (Canva/CapCut-style) built on `@remotion/player`, hosted by a Vite app in `editor/`. **The live preview IS the `Timeline` composition** that renders to MP4 — exact WYSIWYG. **Registry-driven:** every effect/transition picker reads `src/effects` via `editor/src/lib/effects-bridge.ts`, so a motion added to `portable.ts`+`catalog.ts` appears in the editor with zero editor edits (the whole point — scales with the library). Full how-to in `EDITOR_GUIDE.md`.
- **Layout:** Topbar (undo/redo · Save/Export/Import/Reset · ⏺ Render) · Library (Effects/Transitions/Assets) · Preview (Player + on-canvas drag/scale/rotate + click-select) · Inspector (per-item props incl. effect multi-select) · Timeline (clip track + per-overlay lanes, drag-retime/resize, scrub, ▲▼ reorder = z-order). Overlay types: `text`, `image`, and **`fx`** (a full-frame effect layer — "+ FX" — that fills the frame and stacks full-frame motions like petals/bokeh/scanlines on top of the clips; excluded from canvas transform handles since it's full-frame; pairs with overlays-only ProRes export to composite over footage).
- **Canvas transform** (`editor/src/components/CanvasOverlay.tsx`): the Player fills an exact composition-aspect box so screen↔composition mapping is uniform (`editor/src/lib/coords.ts`); `react-moveable` drives `patchOverlay` (drag→x/y, **scalable** corner→scale, rotate→rotation — all center-anchored to match the composition). Overlay nodes are tagged `data-ovl-index` in `Layer.tsx` (render-safe) for measuring. Edits flow store→Player live.
- **Storyboard view** (`editor/src/components/Storyboard.tsx`; **Edit | Storyboard** toggle in the Topbar, `view` state in the store): a clip-tied card board — each card IS a clip (footage thumbnail / video first-frame / placeholder + editable duration + **Label**/**Notes** + `src` + inline "→ next" transition picker; native-HTML5 drag-to-reorder via `reorderClip`, ◀▶ buttons, "+ Add shot", click-to-select carries into Edit). Clips gained two optional render-ignored fields `label`/`note` (`schema.ts`); Storyboard ⇄ Edit share `project.clips`. Overlays/titles/fx are NOT storyboard cards (edited in the Edit tab).
- **State:** zustand + zundo (`editor/src/store.ts`) — only `project` is undoable; autosaves to `localStorage`, seeded from `projects/sample.json`.
- **In-app render + persistence** (`editor/render-plugin.ts`, a Vite dev-server plugin): `POST /api/render` (bundle once → `selectComposition` → `renderMedia`, streamed NDJSON progress) · `POST /api/save-project` (→ `projects/*.json`) · `GET /api/media` (scans `public/` + `public/media/`). Same renderer/output as `npx remotion render Timeline --props=<json>`.
- **Export modes** (format picker by the Render button → `options` in the POST body): `mp4` (H.264) · `alpha` (transparent ProRes 4444 `.mov`, `yuva444p10le`) · `overlays` (alpha + clip track dropped = just the VFX/titles). The alpha modes set `background:none` (Timeline renders a transparent root when `background.type==='none'`) and overlays-only empties `clips`, so you export elements to composite + beat-cut in DaVinci/Premiere. Verified: `yuva444p` ProRes carries a real alpha channel.
- **Editor has its own tsconfig** (`editor/tsconfig.json`, ESNext/Bundler) — the root `tsconfig.json` excludes `editor/`. Typecheck the editor with `npx tsc -p editor/tsconfig.json`. Editor-only deps (`@remotion/player`, `react-moveable`, `selecto`, `zustand`, `zundo`, `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `@types/react-dom`) are pinned in `package.json`.
- **Not yet:** multi-track/marquee multi-select, keyframes, `<Audio>` + real beat-sync. (Single-selection model; selecto deferred in favor of click-select + reorder.)

## No-npm Retro Portal (`index.html`)
A self-contained synthwave/arcade playground at the project root — **double-click to open, no npm, no server**. It is a live preview/composer (CSS driven by `requestAnimationFrame`), NOT the render pipeline. **The portal's motion effects + `composeStyles` are SINGLE-SOURCED**: it loads `public/portal/effects.bundle.js` (generated from `src/effects/portable.ts` by `npm run gen:portal`) and drives its MOTIONS tab + stacking from `window.SoranjiEffects` — it declares zero motion formulas of its own, so a formula added to `portable.ts` shows up here and in the render with no hand-mirroring. `npm run check:portal` (or `check-portal.bat`) guards against a stale bundle, and `predev`/`prerender:timeline` regenerate it automatically. Stack multiple motions at once (transforms + filters concatenated, opacity multiplied). Tabs: MOTIONS (multi-select stacking), BACKDROP (synthGrid/starfield/CRT), TRANSITIONS (A↔B loop + "play all"). Sprite loads from `public/orange-mush.gif` (sibling), with an inlined base64 fallback. The TRANSITIONS tab keeps its own CSS approximations (⚡) inline (transitions are out of the single-source scope). (`.claude/launch.json` + `.claude/static-server.mjs` are a dev-only static server for previewing it.)

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Remotion Studio
- `npm run editor` — Soranji Studio drag-and-drop editor (Vite, :5173); `npm run editor:build` to bundle it
- `npm run build` / `npx remotion bundle` — bundle; `npm run typecheck` (`tsc`) for types; `npx tsc -p editor/tsconfig.json` for the editor

## Stage roadmap
- Stage 2 (shader pipeline): wrap `makeHtmlInCanvasPresentation()` to ingest more gl-transitions GLSL. Remotion shader time is REVERSED vs gl-transitions — add `float progress = 1.0 - u_time;`. Keep license notices; run `npm run credits`.
- Stage 3: `@remotion/three` for the `todo` true-3D motions; wire `@remotion/media-utils` (`useAudioData`/`visualizeAudio`) for real audio-reactive beat.
